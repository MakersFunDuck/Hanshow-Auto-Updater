    A fully-functional Snipping Tool with Tkinter 
</p>

## Sypnosis

Select the mode of screenshot (fullscreen or region), set delay and take your snip. Note that for rectangular snips, delay is not supported (and not even desireable in the first place) 

## Installation

Install the [requirements](#requirements)
```bash
pip install pygame
pip install pyautogui
pip install customtkinter
```

## Contribution

I will refactor this code in OOP, add free-form snips, elliptical snips, etc and add post-production effects to the snip (like scribble,drop-down shadow,etc). Any help would be desirable. A seperate repository will be created for the purpose and you can commit [there](TODO)
